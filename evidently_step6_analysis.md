  - Features: Interactive Plotly charts, responsive design, complete styling
- **JSON Export**: Structured data export for programmatic consumption
  - Multiple formats: `dict()`, `dumps()`, `save_json()` methods
  - Standards-compliant JSON with numpy array handling
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line report generation with configurable outputs
  - Command: `evidently report CONFIG_PATH input OUTPUT`
  - Options: `--save-report`, `--save-dataset`, `--test-summary`
- **Interactive Dashboard UI**: Web service with project dashboards
  - Location: `/src/evidently/ui/service/`
  - Features: Multi-tab dashboards, panel management, snapshot browsing
  - API endpoints for programmatic access at `/src/evidently/ui/service/api/projects.py`
**Limitations:**
- No native PDF export capability
- Limited CSV/Parquet export (only through pandas dependency)
- No built-in compliance or audit report templates

### S6P3: Create interactive visualizations and exploratory tools
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- **Plotly Integration**: Heavy use of Plotly for interactive visualizations
  - Location: Multiple files in `/src/evidently/metrics/` and `/src/evidently/legacy/renderers/html_widgets.py`
  - Features: `plotly_figure()` function for embedding interactive charts
  - Types: Scatter plots, histograms, distribution plots, drift visualizations
- **Web UI Service**: Full dashboard service with exploration capabilities
  - Command: `evidently ui --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`
  - Features: Project workspace, snapshot comparison, drill-down views
  - Location: `/src/evidently/ui/service/app.py`
- **Widget System**: Modular widget architecture for custom visualizations
  - Location: `/src/evidently/legacy/renderers/html_widgets.py`
  - Supports: Counters, tables, plots, tabs, custom HTML components
**Limitations:**
- No Bokeh or other visualization library integration beyond Plotly
- Limited filtering and exploration tools in the UI
- No export of interactive visualizations as standalone applications
- Dashboard customization requires code changes

### S6P4: Archive for reproducibility
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- **Snapshot Serialization**: Complete state capture with load/save capabilities
  - Methods: `to_snapshot_model()`, `load()`, `loads()`, `load_dict()`
  - Location: `/src/evidently/core/report.py` lines 422-463
  - Includes: Full metric results, configurations, timestamps, metadata
- **Configuration Preservation**: Report configurations stored with results
  - All metric parameters and settings preserved in snapshot
  - Metadata tracking with tags and custom fields
- **Workspace Persistence**: File-based storage system maintains project history
  - Location: `/src/evidently/ui/storage/local/base.py`
  - Features: Project metadata, snapshot collections, dashboard configs
**Limitations:**
- No automatic environment capture (requirements.txt, system info)
- No container image or dependency versioning
- Random seed preservation not automatic (requires manual configuration)
- No built-in checksumming or integrity verification
- Limited version control integration

### S6P5: Publish to appropriate channels
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- **CLI Interface**: Basic command-line execution and output generation
  - Commands: `evidently report`, `evidently ui`
  - File-based input/output with configurable paths
- **Web API**: REST API for programmatic access and integration
  - Location: `/src/evidently/ui/service/api/`
  - Endpoints: Project management, snapshot upload/retrieval, dashboard access
  - Authentication: Optional secret-based auth for write operations
- **Workspace Service**: Local web service for team collaboration
  - Multi-project workspace with persistent storage
  - Demo project generation for testing: `--demo-projects bikes`
**Limitations:**
- No built-in CI/CD pipeline integrations (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- No native MLOps platform connectors (MLflow, W&B, Neptune)
- No model registry integration
- No webhook or notification system
- Limited to local file system and HTTP API publishing
- No artifact repository support beyond local storage

## Key Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Excellent HTML and JSON export capabilities with rich interactive content
2. **Interactive Visualizations**: Strong Plotly integration with responsive dashboards
3. **State Preservation**: Good snapshot/serialization system for reproducing evaluations
4. **Modular Architecture**: Extensible widget and metric system
5. **Web Service**: Complete UI service with API for team collaboration

## Key Gaps
1. **External Integrations**: Minimal support for MLOps platforms and CI/CD systems
2. **Advanced Packaging**: No compression, bundling, or trace collection utilities  
3. **Environment Capture**: Limited reproducibility tooling for dependencies and system state
4. **Export Formats**: Missing PDF reports and advanced data export formats
5. **Publishing Channels**: Lacks connectors to external artifact repositories and registries

## Overall Assessment
Evidently provides **good to partial support** for Step 6 SHIP processes, with particular strength in report generation and visualization capabilities. However, it requires significant custom integration work for enterprise MLOps workflows and external system connectivity. The framework is well-suited for teams that can work within its local/web-service paradigm but may need additional tooling for full production deployment pipelines.
