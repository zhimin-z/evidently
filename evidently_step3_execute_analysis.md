### S3P3: Handle multi-turn interactions and tool use scenarios
**Rating:** 0
**Evidence:**
- `src/evidently/llm/models.py`: Only basic LLMMessage class with role/content

- No context window or conversation history handling
- Framework focuses on single evaluation runs rather than interactive scenarios
**Limitations:**
- No multi-turn conversation support
- No dialogue state management
- No tool use evaluation capabilities

**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- `src/evidently/llm/utils/wrapper.py` (lines 222-233): Basic retry logic in `_run` method
- `LLMRequest` has retries parameter
- Rate limiting acts as basic circuit breaker pattern
- Basic exception handling for OpenAI API errors (lines 359-362)
- FileLock timeout in `src/evidently/telemetry.py` (timeout=5)
**Limitations:**
- No exponential backoff strategies
- No dedicated circuit breaker implementation
- Limited timeout mechanisms
- No fallback mechanisms for failing services
- Retry logic only in LLM operations

### S3P5: Track resource consumption and costs
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- `src/evidently/llm/utils/wrapper.py`: Token usage tracking with input_tokens and output_tokens
- `RateLimits` class for managing API rate limits (rpm, tpm, itpm, otpm)
- `src/evidently/llm/optimization/optimizer.py`: Token consumption logging and reporting
- Rate limiter tracks token usage over time intervals
- Basic usage statistics in optimizer logs
**Limitations:**
- No cost calculation or budget controls
- No compute resource utilization monitoring
- No cost alerting mechanisms
- Limited to token counting only
- No comprehensive resource accounting

### S3P6: Checkpoint progress for long-running evaluations
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- `src/evidently/llm/optimization/optimizer.py` (lines 5-10): Basic checkpoint_path parameter and commented checkpoint loading code
- `src/evidently/llm/optimization/prompts.py`: `resume` method for optimizer runs
- Progress tracking exists in report calculation context
- Basic state management in optimizer context
**Limitations:**
- Checkpointing limited to LLM optimization only
- No general evaluation checkpointing system
- No progress bars or estimation
- Checkpoint loading code is commented out
- No resumption of interrupted general evaluations

## Framework Overview
Evidently is primarily designed as a monitoring and evaluation framework for ML and LLM systems, with a focus on data drift detection, model performance evaluation, and report generation. The framework excels at generating comprehensive evaluation reports but has limited support for advanced execution orchestration, multi-turn interactions, and sophisticated reliability measures that would be expected in a full evaluation harness.

The framework's strengths lie in its comprehensive metric collection, preset configurations, and monitoring dashboard capabilities. However, it lacks the execution sophistication needed for complex evaluation workflows, particularly around pipeline routing, advanced instrumentation, conversation handling, and robust execution management.
