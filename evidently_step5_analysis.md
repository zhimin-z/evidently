## Detailed Analysis

### S5P1: Compute aggregate statistics
**Rating:** 3
**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive statistical metrics in `src/evidently/metrics/column_statistics.py`: MeanValue, MedianValue, MinValue, MaxValue, StdValue, QuantileValue, SumValue
- Dataset-level aggregations in `src/evidently/metrics/dataset_statistics.py`: RowCount, DuplicatedRowCount, ColumnCount, etc.
- Weighted aggregation support through GroupBy functionality in `src/evidently/metrics/group_by.py`
- Missing data handling: MissingValueCount, DatasetMissingValueCount metrics
- Custom aggregation functions supported through metric framework
- Outlier handling through quantile-based metrics and value range checks (InRangeValueCount, OutRangeValueCount)
**Limitations:**
None significant - robust statistical aggregation capabilities are well-documented and implemented.

### S5P2: Perform stratified analysis
**Rating:** 3
**Evidence:**
- Native GroupBy class in `src/evidently/metrics/group_by.py` enables slicing by any column/attribute
- Multi-dimensional stratification through chained GroupBy operations
- Built-in fairness metrics in classification and regression presets
- Data slicing utilities through Dataset.subdataset() method in core datasets
- Cross-tabulation supported through correlation metrics in `src/evidently/metrics/data_quality.py`
- Demographic bias analysis available in classification quality by class metrics
- Example usage in `examples/cookbook/metrics.ipynb` shows stratification patterns
**Limitations:**
None significant - comprehensive stratification capabilities with good API design.

### S5P3: Generate diagnostic visualizations
**Rating:** 3
**Evidence:**
- Confusion matrices: ClassificationConfusionMatrix in `src/evidently/legacy/metrics/classification_performance/`
- ROC curves: ClassificationRocCurve with full ROC curve generation
- PR curves: ClassificationPRCurve for precision-recall analysis
- Calibration plots available through probability distribution metrics
- Error distribution visualizations in `src/evidently/legacy/metrics/regression_performance/error_distribution.py`
- Interactive plotting through Plotly integration in `src/evidently/legacy/utils/visualizations.py`
- Export capabilities: HTML, JSON, Python dict formats supported
- Rich visualization ecosystem with 100+ chart types across classification, regression, drift analysis
- Custom plotting supported through the widget system
**Limitations:**
None significant - comprehensive visualization capabilities with multiple export formats.

### S5P4: Analyze performance-quality tradeoffs and failure patterns
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- Error bias analysis in `src/evidently/legacy/metrics/regression_performance/error_bias_table.py`
- Top error analysis in `src/evidently/legacy/metrics/regression_performance/top_error.py`
- Error pattern detection through error distribution and normality tests
- Performance profiling through error-in-time plots and predicted vs actual analysis
- Systematic failure pattern identification in regression top error metrics
- Statistical testing framework for significance analysis in `src/evidently/legacy/calculations/stattests/`
**Limitations:**
- Limited direct latency vs accuracy curve generation
- No dedicated performance profiler for computational metrics
- Tradeoff analysis requires manual construction from individual metrics
- Missing dedicated root cause analysis tools

### S5P5: Rank and compare models against baselines
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- Basic model comparison through DummyMetric classes (DummyF1Score, DummyPrecision, etc.)
- Reference vs current data comparison in all metrics
- Baseline tracking through Reference test conditions
- Report-level comparison by running multiple reports
- Statistical significance testing available through the stattests module
**Limitations:**
- No dedicated leaderboard or ranking functionality
- No automated model comparison tables
- No built-in relative improvement metrics computation
- Requires significant custom code to implement comprehensive model comparison
- Missing automated statistical significance testing for model comparisons

## Overall Assessment

Evidently demonstrates **excellent support** for core analysis processes (S5P1-S5P3) with comprehensive statistical aggregation, sophisticated stratification capabilities, and rich diagnostic visualizations. The framework provides **good support** for error analysis (S5P4) with detailed failure pattern detection, though it lacks some advanced performance profiling features. **Basic support** exists for model comparison (S5P5), but this area requires significant custom implementation for full functionality.

The framework's strength lies in its modular architecture, extensive statistical testing capabilities (20+ statistical tests), and excellent visualization ecosystem. It handles complex use cases well for data analysis and model evaluation but requires additional tooling for comprehensive model ranking and comparison workflows.
